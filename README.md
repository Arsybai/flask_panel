Just like a CPanel. but it's for python Flask only.
The reason I make this is because my personal problem that I always manually deploy my app to my server.

---
### Requirements
- Ubuntu server with `sudo`
- python3
- screen
- a domain that already add `A` record to public server IP
_`Note: Disable proxy, for certbot installation. you can enable it after installation done`_

### Step 1
Clone or download or anything this repo and put to your server.
I recomended here
```
root
 â”— ðŸ“¦flask_panel
    â”£ ðŸ“‚ flask_panel
    â”£ ðŸ“œconfig.json
    â”£ ðŸ“œflask_panel.py
    â”£ ðŸ“œflask_panel.sql
    â”— ðŸ“œREADME.md
```

### Step 2
Set up the config file in `config.json`
```json
{
    "admin":{
        "username":"admin",
        "password":".Admin1234"
    },

    "server_name": {
        "flask_panel": "panel.example.com",
        "phpmyadmin":"database.example.com"
    },

    "phpver": "8.1"
}
```
- the `admin` is login access to your flask panel
- the `server_name` is a domain with `A` record to your public server IP. 

Example setting DNS A record

## Step 3
get into flask_panel directory
```bash
$cd flask_panel
```
and run the installation
```bash
$python3 flask_panel.py
```

if this appear, just hit enter and enter

_Note: do not restart it_

if this appear, press tab until the red box hit `<Ok>` and press enter
![img](https://images.arsybai.app/images/SilOJuHpHM.png)
it because flask_panel use nginx. so you don't need apache2 and lighttpd

if this appear, just hit yes and input whatever you want.

if the email input appear, just input your email. it's for certbot installation then y,y,y

if the `App running..` apperear, thats mean installation done.
access your panel with flask_panel server_name
